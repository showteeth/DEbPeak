Description: DEbPeak aims to explore, visualize, interpret multi-omics data and unravel the regulation of gene expression by 
    combining RNA-seq with peak-related data (eg: ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, m6a-seq et al.). It contains nine functional panels: 
    Parse GEO, Quality Control (QC), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Differential Analysis (DA), Functional Enrichment Analysis (FEA), 
    Integrate RNA-seq with peak-related data (support the simultaneous integration of two kinds of peak-related data), 
    Integrate RNA-seq with RNA-seq, Integrate peak-related data with peak-related data, Utils.
